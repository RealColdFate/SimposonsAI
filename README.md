# SimposonsAI
Just an educational project for a CNN model that recognizes characters from the show the Simpsons

# Description 
Using the the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset
which is a dataset of images of simpsons characters I organize the data and create a fine tuned version of the mobile net model 
that recognizes simpsons characters. Then using open cv and tensorflow I created a script that will allow you to test the model live on a webcam.
To use some of the files in this repo you will have to download and unzip the data from the kaggle link above.
The data path should be data/simpsons_dataset/*
